<p>According to wikipedia, "Data deduplication is a specific form of compression where redundant data is eliminated, typically to improve storage utilization. In the deduplication process, duplicate data is deleted, leaving only one copy of the data to be stored. However, indexing of all data is still retained should that data ever be required. Deduplication is able to reduce the required storage capacity since only the unique data is stored. </p>

<ol>
<li>file-level Deduplication</li>
<li>Block-level Deduplication</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>file-level deduplication</strong> watches for multiple copies of the same file, stores the first copy, and then just links the other references to the first file. Only one copy gets stored on the disk/tape archive. Ultimately, the space you save on disk relates to how many copies of the file there were in the file system.</p>

<p>lets assume a company having a 1000 employee share a common file say "data.txt" which is 10MB in Size.Each employee do the same changes and save the exact similar 1000 copies of file on server.so estimated storage require to save a file on server side is 10 GB.</p>

<p>Here the point is if All the files are identical then why to upload all the files on server.just save a single copy on server and put a pointers in a users folder that points to a single copy on server.So thats how Data Deduplication technique used to save the TB's of storage.</p>

<p><strong>Block-level Deduplication</strong>, sometimes called variable block-level deduplication, looks at the data block itself to see if another copy of this block already exists. If so, the second (and subsequent) copies are not stored on the disk/tape, but a link/pointer is created to point to the original copy.</p>

<p>lets say we have three users each having 4 data blocks.Green and Gray blocks are common in three users so they backed up in data center.Blue,red and purple block are common between two users hence they backed up in Data center.
Here the Important point is the memory required for block data in data storage is very less which is equal to sizeof(block) in memory.</p>

<p>Block level deduplication is always efficient then file-level deduplication because In file level you have to dump whole file in data storage if its version changed where as in block level you have to dump the changed block which takes comparatively less space in data storage.</p>

<p>In Block-level deduplication we parse the data in terms of blocks.</p>

<p><strong>Steps For Algorithm</strong></p>

<pre><code>1. Start
2. Declare Variable 
3. Initialize variable
4. Read 1024 bytes from file in tone iteration
5. Read from file until reach EOF
   5.1 Generate Hash Value from strBuff[BLOCKSIZE]
   5.2 if (FirstBlock) 
          Consider node as root element
          Inc BlockCtr
       else
          search the generated Hash in BST
          if (Find Hash == True)
             Compute the Node
             Add the Node to a linked List 
             Change the EndLink of SLL
          else
             Add the node in BST
             Inc The BLockCounter
6. Calculate Deduplication Ratio
7. Display the Result for each iteration
8. END 
</code></pre>

<p>We have a diagrammatic representation which includes BST and SLL that we are created during parsing of file at block level</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.rt</p>
